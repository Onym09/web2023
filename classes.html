        <h1>My favorite classes so far have been:</h1>
        <br>
        <div id = "classes">
            <p id = "science">Scientific Thinking 3</p>
            <br>
            <p id = "enviro">Environmental Practices</p>
            <br>
            <p id = "lit">Literary Thinking 3</p>

        </div>

        <br>
        <p>I love science because it has covered many topics that I didn't know about, while still being understandable. The assignments can be sometimes irritating, but are generally really fun! </p>
        <br>
        <p>I like Environmental Practices, because in that class we cover a lot of ground about problems like climate change, pollution, food scarcity and more. Every class is different and educational.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I like Literary Thinking because it's a very chill class. We don't have many assignments, but the ones we do have are usually focused on Membean and NoRedInk, which are both learning websites that I enjoy using. It's a really fun class and has definitally been one of my favorites this trimester.</p>
