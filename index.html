            <li>My name is Hannah, I am fourteen.</li> <br>
            <br>
            <li>I love reading and it is a significant part of my life. It’s quite fun to read books that are actually good.</li> <br>
            <br>
            <li>I also play piano which is pretty fun for me.</li> <br>
            <br>
            <li>I also like to watch YouTube, like literally everyone else. I watch many types of content, as my Youtube resets every time I go on it because I don’t have an account. This makes it actually enjoyable to watch and the randomness really adds to it.</li><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>I play two different sports over the course of the year. I row in the fall and spring for 5 days a week, and it’s really fun and has a great community. In the winter I play Basketball for 2 days, and it’s quite different to rowing, so I am doing different things over the course of the year. Basketball allows me to have a lot more time to do things, and therefore I can work on homework more.</li><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>As for my family, I have one sister and no other siblings. She is two years older than me and also goes to Eastside Preparatory school.</li><br>
            <br>
            <li>I’m excited for fall trimester to be over even though its been fun, it will be nice to have new electives and have my schedule reordered. Since I’m in eighth grade I will have a free period in the spring, and I’m looking forward to it.</li><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Finals are not great, but soon they will be over, and I’ll get to go on break.</li><br>
