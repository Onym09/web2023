        <p id = "review">Batman Begins is a amazing movie that tells the story of how Batman became Batman, referencing the 'Begins' part in the title. It's like a superhero origin story, but way better. The main guy, Bruce Wayne, goes through some tough stuff, and then decides he wants to fight bad guys in a bat suit.
            
            The action is awesome, with lots of fights and cool gadgets. The bad guys are terrible people and have only a slightly tragic backstory which is great!
            
            The acting is great, and it is has many amazing actors, such as Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman.

            The best part is that Batman Begins isn't just about punching bad guys. It has a good story about fear and justice. Just kidding, the fights are really fun to watch.
            
            If you like action, cool superheroes, and a bit of drama, Batman Begins is the movie for you. Go watch it!

            5/5 Stars!
