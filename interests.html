        <h2>Interests you say? Here's some of mine.</h2>

        <p>I love listening to music. While doing my homework I let YouTube autoplay everything, and it very helpful for studying. My favorite bands to listen to are:
            <br><li>Wallows</li>
            <br><li>Artic Monkeys</li>
            <br><li>Lovejoy</li>
            <br>They each are very different but they all have great music.
            <br>
            <br>My favorite tv shows to watch are:
            <br><li>Death Note</li>
            <br><li>Stranger Things</li>
            <br>Death Note is really interesting and has a lot of twists which makes it really cool to watch. Stranger Things has an awesome story line and I really enjoyed watching it with my friend.
            <br>
            <br>My favorite book is ‘Six of Crows’. It’s amazing. The detail, the worlding building, and characters are just wonderful. It has so many cool twists! its brilliance revealed in the subtle interplay of characters and plot intricacies.  Twists in the narrative are akin to hidden traps. The ensemble cast, a convergence of diverse talents, orchestrates a symphony of chaos. Theres many places where there are unpredictable alliances and unforeseen consequences, which help make the novel be amazing. 
            <br>
            <br>Reading is something I do after school, but I also like watching movies. My favorites include:
            <br><li>‘Knives Out’</li>
            <br><li>‘The Dark Knight’ trilogy</li>
             
            <br>Knives Out was really funny and was so unexpected the entire time I was watching it. I couldn’t predict anything that would happen in it. The Dark Knight trilogy was really cool and I think it was some of the best movies I have ever watched. Also, it was entirely done without CGI.
